# Canteen-Food-Ordering-System
The system offers customers the ability to peruse menus, add desired items to their cart, place orders, make payments, and review their order history. Administrators, on the other hand, have the capacity to oversee shop information, menus, customer orders, and revenue reports. Prior to implementation, comprehensive and thorough documentation was generated, adhering to the established standards of agile methodology, in order to support the work process effectively.

More technically, the system is built using PHP and utilizes a MySQL database to store and manage data. The front-end user interface is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an intuitive and user-friendly experience for customers and administrators.
